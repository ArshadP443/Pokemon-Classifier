In the mitesobjectdetectiontest, we all collaborated on the code together, and took inspiration from Dan DeGenaro. Most of the code in this file was written by Mr. DeGenaro, Henry, and Minghui.
My main job during this period was helping find a way to save the tensors, and luckily, I found torch.save(), while Henry Dang was able to implement it.
