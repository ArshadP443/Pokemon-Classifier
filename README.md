# Pokemon-Classifier

Hello! This respository is a collection of one the projects I did during MIT's Minority Introduction to Engineering and STEM (MITES) Semester.
In this project, I created a classifier that is able to distinguish pokemon into 11 smogon tiers. The link to explain the tiers are here:

My model is able to classify pokemon into Little Cup, PU, PUBL, NU, NUBL, RU, RUBL, UU, UUBL, OU, and Ubers.
This model is also able to take user input so you can create your own custom pokemon.
